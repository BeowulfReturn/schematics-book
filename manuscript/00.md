# Introduction

Besides it's creative aspects, programming also involves performing repeating tasks. Some of them can be solved by creating reusable libraries. For the rest, we can leverage code generation. This is what this book is about. It shows how to make use of Schematics, the code generator behind the Angular CLI to generate custom Angular code. Using an example, you will learn how to scaffold a new Schematics project, how to work with templates and how to manipulate existing code.

## Schematics

The Angular CLI uses a library called [Schematics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-devkit/schematics) to scaffold building blocks like components or services. One of the best things about this is that Schematics allows to create own code generators too. Using this extension mechanism, we can [modify the way the CLI generates code](https://blog.angularindepth.com/creating-your-own-application-template-for-angular-cli-95e22319cc24). But we can also provide custom collections with code generators and publish them as npm packages. A good example for this is [Nrwl's Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx) which allows to generated boilerplate code for [Ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) or upgrading an existing application from AngularJS 1.x to Angular.

These code generators are also called Schematics and can not only create new files but also modify existing ones. For instance, the CLI uses the latter to register generated components with existing modules.

## Used Version and Angular Labs

The samples shown are using Angular 5.x and the Angular CLI 1.6. When writing this, Schematics' was a Angular Labs Project which means that it is experimental and can change in future.

## BETA-Book

This book is currently in BETA. This means that there will be updates to respect additional features and erratas or typos. Using Leanpub you can always download the newest version.
