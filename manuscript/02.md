# Modifying existing Files with existing Helper Functions

In the last chapter, I've shown how to leverage Schematics, the Angular CLI's code generator, to scaffold custom components. This chapter goes one step further and shows how to register generated building blocks like Components, Directives, Pipes, or Services with an existing ``NgModule``. For this I'll extend the example from the last chapter that generates a ``SideMenuComponent``. The [source code shown here](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/custom-schematics-modifying-ngmodules) can also be found in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/custom-schematics-modifying-ngmodules).

## Update an NgModule

To register the generated ``SideMenuComponent`` we need to perform several tasks. For instance, we have to lookup the file with respective ``NgModule``. After this, we have to insert several lines into this file:

```TypeScript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

// Add this line to reference component
import { SideMenuComponent } from './side-menu/side-menu.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  
  // Add this Line
  declarations: [SideMenuComponent],

  // Add this Line if we want to export the component too
  exports: [SideMenuComponent]
})
export class CoreModule { }
```

As you've seen in the last listing, we have to create an ``import`` statement at the beginning of the file. And then we have to add the imported component to the ``declarations`` array and - if the caller requests it - to the ``exports`` array too. If those arrays don't exist, we have to create them too.

The good message is, that the Angular CLI contains existing code for such tasks. Hence, we don't have to build everything from scratch. The next section shows some of those existing utility functions.

## Utility Functions provided by the Angular CLI

The Schematics Collection ``@schematics/angular`` used by the Angular CLI for generating stuff like components or services turns out to be a real gold mine for modifying existing ``NgModules``. For instance, you find some function to look up modules within ``@schematics/angular/utility/find-module``. The following table shows two of them which I will use in the course of this chapter:

| Function 					| Description |
|----------|-------------|
| findModuleFromOptions		| Looks up the current module file. For this, it starts in a given folder and looks for a file with the suffix ``.module.ts`` while the suffix ``.routing.module.ts`` is not accepted. If nothing has been found in the current folder, its parent folders are searched.|
| buildRelativePath		    | Builds a relative path that points from one file to another one. This function comes in handy for generating the ``import`` statement pointing from the module file to the file with the component to register. |

Another file containing useful utility functions is ``@schematics/angular/utility/ast-utils``. It helps with modifying existing ``TypeScript`` files by leveraging services provided by the TypeScript compiler. The next table shows some of its functions used here:

| Function					| Description	|
|---------------------------|---------------|
| addDeclarationToModule	| Adds a component, directive or pipe to the ``declarations`` array of an ``NgModule``. If necessary, this array is created|
| addExportToModule			| Adds an export to the ``NgModule``|

There are also other methods that add entries to the other sections of an ``NgModule`` (``addImportToModule``, ``addProviderToModule``, ``addBootstrapToModule``).

Please note, that those files are currently not part of the package's public API. Therefore, they can change in future. To be on the safe side, [Hans Larsen](https://twitter.com/hanslatwork) from the Angular CLI Team suggested to fork it. [My fork](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/devkit) of the [DevKit Repository](https://github.com/angular/devkit) containing those functions can be found [here](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/devkit). 

After forking, I've copied the contents of the folder ``packages\schematics\angular\utility`` containing the functions in question to the folder [``schematics-angular-utils`` in my project](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/custom-schematics-modifying-ngmodules/tree/master/nav/src/schematics-angular-utils) and adjusted some ``import`` statements. For the time being, you can also copy [my folder with this adjustments](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/custom-schematics-modifying-ngmodules/tree/master/nav/src/schematics-angular-utils) for your own projects. I think that sooner or later the API will stabilize and be published as a public one so that we don't need this workaround.

## Creating a Rule for adding a Declaration to an NgModule

After we've seen that there are handy utility functions, let's use them to build a ``Rule`` for our endeavor. For this, we use a folder ``utils`` with the following two files:

{width=50%}
![Utils for custom Rule](images/utils-for-adding-to-ngmodule.png)

The file ``add-to-module-context.ts`` gets a context class holding data for the planned modifications:

```TypeScript
import * as ts from 'typescript';

export class AddToModuleContext {
    // source of the module file
    source: ts.SourceFile;

    // the relative path that points from  
    // the module file to the component file
    relativePath: string;

    // name of the component class
    classifiedName: string;
}
```

In the other file, ``ng-module-utils.ts``, a factory function for the needed rule is created: 

```TypeScript
import { Rule, Tree, SchematicsException } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';
import { AddToModuleContext } from './add-to-module-context';
import * as ts from 'typescript';
import { dasherize, classify } from '@angular-devkit/core';

import { ModuleOptions, buildRelativePath } 
  from '../schematics-angular-utils/find-module';
import { addDeclarationToModule, addExportToModule } 
  from '../schematics-angular-utils/ast-utils';
import { InsertChange } from '../schematics-angular-utils/change';


const stringUtils = { dasherize, classify };

export function addDeclarationToNgModule(
                  options: ModuleOptions, exports: boolean): Rule {
  return (host: Tree) => {
   [...]
  };
}
```

This function takes an ``ModuleOptions`` instance that describes the ``NgModule`` in question. It can be deduced by the options object containing the command line arguments the caller passes to the CLI.

It also takes a flag ``exports`` that indicates whether the declared component should be exported too. The returned ``Rule`` is just a function that gets a ``Tree`` object representing the part of the file system it modifies. For implementing this ``Rule`` I've looked up the implementation of similar rules within the CLI's Schematics in ``@schematics/angular`` and "borrowed" the patterns found there. Especially the ``Rule`` triggered by ``ng generated component`` was very helpful for this.

Before we discuss how this function is implemented, let's have a look at some helper functions I've put in the same file. The first one collects the ``context`` information we've talked about before:

```TypeScript
function createAddToModuleContext(
            host: Tree, options: ModuleOptions): AddToModuleContext {

  const result = new AddToModuleContext();

  if (!options.module) {
    throw new SchematicsException(`Module not found.`);
  }

  // Reading the module file
  const text = host.read(options.module);

  if (text === null) {
    throw new SchematicsException(`File ${options.module} does not exist.`);
  }

  const sourceText = text.toString('utf-8');
  result.source = ts.createSourceFile(
                          options.module, 
                          sourceText, 
                          ts.ScriptTarget.Latest, 
                          true);

  const componentPath = `/${options.sourceDir}/${options.path}/`
		      + stringUtils.dasherize(options.name) + '/'
		      + stringUtils.dasherize(options.name)
		      + '.component';

  result.relativePath = buildRelativePath(options.module, componentPath);

  result.classifiedName = stringUtils.classify(`${options.name}Component`);

  return result;

}
```

The second helper function is ``addDeclaration``. It delegates to ``addDeclarationToModule`` located within the package ``@schematics/angular`` to add the component to the module's ``declarations`` array:  

```TypeScript
function addDeclaration(host: Tree, options: ModuleOptions) {

  const context = createAddToModuleContext(host, options);
  const modulePath = options.module || '';

  const declarationChanges = addDeclarationToModule(
			      context.source,
			      modulePath,
			      context.classifiedName,
			      context.relativePath);

  const declarationRecorder = host.beginUpdate(modulePath);
  for (const change of declarationChanges) {
    if (change instanceof InsertChange) {
      declarationRecorder.insertLeft(change.pos, change.toAdd);
    }
  }
  host.commitUpdate(declarationRecorder);
};
```

The ``addDeclarationToModule`` function takes the retrieved context information and the ``modulePath`` from the passed ``ModuleOptions``. Instead of directly updating the module file it returns an array with necessary modifications. These are iterated and applied to the module file within a transaction, started with ``beginUpdate`` and completed with ``commitUpdate``. 

The second helper function is ``addExport``. It adds the component to the module's ``exports`` array and works exactly like the ``addDeclaration``:

```TypeScript
function addExport(host: Tree, options: ModuleOptions) {
  const context = createAddToModuleContext(host, options);
  const modulePath = options.module || '';

  const exportChanges = addExportToModule(
				context.source,
				modulePath,
				context.classifiedName,
				context.relativePath);

  const exportRecorder = host.beginUpdate(modulePath);

  for (const change of exportChanges) {
    if (change instanceof InsertChange) {
      exportRecorder.insertLeft(change.pos, change.toAdd);
    }
  }
  host.commitUpdate(exportRecorder);
};
```

Now, as we've looked at these helper function, let's finish the implementation of our ``Rule``:

```TypeScript
export function addDeclarationToNgModule(
                  options: ModuleOptions, exports: boolean): Rule {
  return (host: Tree) => {
    addDeclaration(host, options);
    if (exports) {
      addExport(host, options);
    }
    return host;
  };
}
```

As you've seen, it just delegates to ``addDeclaration`` and ``addExport``. After this, it returns the modified file tree represented by the variable ``host``.

## Extending the used Options Class and its JSON schema

Before we put our new ``Rule`` in place, we have to extend the class ``MenuOptions`` which describes the passed (command line) arguments. As usual in Schematics, it's defined in the file ``schema.ts``. For our purpose, it gets two new properties:

```TypeScript
export interface MenuOptions {
    name: string;
    appRoot: string;
    path: string;
    sourceDir: string;
    menuService: boolean;

	// New Properties:
    module: string;
    export: boolean;
}
```

The property ``module`` holds the path for the module file to modify and ``export`` defines whether the generated component should be exported too.  

After this, we have to declare these additional property in the file ``schema.json``:

```JSON
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema",
    "id": "SchemanticsForMenu",
    "title": "Menu Schema",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      [...]
      "module":  {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The declaring module.",
        "alias": "m"
      },
      "export": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": false,
        "description": "Export component from module?"
      }
    }
  }
  
```

As mentioned in the last chapter, we also could generate the file ``schema.ts`` with the information provided by ``schema.json``.

## Calling the Rule

Now, as we've created our rule, let's put it in place. For this, we have to call it within the ``Rule``  function in ``index.ts``:

```TypeScript
export default function (options: MenuOptions): Rule {

    return (host: Tree, context: SchematicContext) => {

      options.path = options.path ? normalize(options.path) : options.path;

	  // Infer module path, if not passed:
      options.module = options.module 
          || findModuleFromOptions(host, options) 
          || '';

      [...]

      const rule = chain([
        branchAndMerge(chain([

          [...]

		  // Call new rule
          addDeclarationToNgModule(options, options.export)

        ])),
      ]);

      return rule(host, context);

    }
}
```

As the passed ``MenuOptions`` object is structurally compatible to the needed ``ModuleOptions`` we can directly pass it to ``addDeclarationToNgModule``. This is the way, the CLI currently deals with option objects. 

In addition to that, we infer the module path at the beginning using ``findModuleFromOptions``.

## Testing the extended Schematic

To try the modified Schematic out, compile it and copy everything to the ``node_modules`` folder of an example application. As in the last chapter, I've decided to copy it to ``node_modules/nav``. Please make sure to exclude the collection's ``node_modules`` folder, so that there is no folder ``node_modules/nav/node_modules``. 

After this, switch to the example application's root, generate a module ``core`` and navigate to its folder:

```
ng g module core
cd src\app\core
```

Now call the custom Schematic:

![Calling Schematic which generated component and registers it with the module](images/calling-schematic-to-update-ngmodule.png)

This not only generates the ``SideMenuComponent`` but also registers it with the ``CoreModule``:

```TypeScript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { SideMenuComponent } from './side-menu/side-menu.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [SideMenuComponent],
  exports: [SideMenuComponent]
})
export class CoreModule { }
```
